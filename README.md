### Unsolved Problems:

1] I want to reslove issues with Set time out properties with fetching data so that it does not continue to appear even after the user signs out.
2] I want to fix a small CSS issue to remove the respective borders from the side of the tables to make it look more like a tic-tac-toe game board.
3] I would like to make it possible to print out the user's previous games in detail.
3] I want to have stricter restrictions when attempting to sign up where it requires an actual email.
4] I was having difficulty with a footer throughout the development process. During deployment, buttons would not properly stay above the footer and be stuck underneath when playing the game.
5] Modal issues with mobile.
6 ]Having the capability to pkay against other players online.
