## Planning and Development:

#### Planning
Going into the project, I was having a very hard time focusing and determining where to start. I began to realize that the most important thing was to create a basic wireframe based on class instructions that would meet MVP. During this process, I lost track of what my MVP was and began adding features to the wireframe that would be an end goal for my first project. To help in the development process, I wrote a long list of user stories to keep my mind on track as to what I as a developer would like to see as well as what a user would like to interact with during their time interacting with the site. These two planning process assisted me in significantly in keeping focus and staying on track.

#### Development
As someone who needs to visually see something, I began the process in an opposite direction direction seperate from the project guides. Prior to learning JS, I was much more comfortable with with HTML and CSS and as such began making a blueprint of what the game board and layout of the page would look like. After I made the blueprint, I proceeded working with the auth ajax request and creating curl scripts to test each ajax request. Eventually they would all be linked to their respective modals and form fields. The next phase was working with Javascript and slowly but surely creating the game logic that would interact with its own ajax requests and ultimately with the gameboard. Some of the hardships I came across while developing, were getting the PATCH request for the game API to work properly and the new game button to properly refresh the gameboard.

 Whenever I felt stuck during the development process, I would take some steps away from my laptop and plan how to work on the issue at hand. If I ever had an issue that I couldn't figure out, I would send in an issue queue and await help from some instructors. In addition to sending in an issue queue, classmates who were stuck on similar problems helped tremendously becuase we were able to share our thoughts and work together to fix the problem(s) that we were working on.

### Unsolved Problems and Future Goals:

1. I want to reslove issues with Set time out properties with fetching data so that it does not continue to appear even after the user signs out.
2. I want to fix a small CSS issue to remove the respective borders from the side of the tables to make it look more like a tic-tac-toe game board.
3. I would like to make it possible to print out the user's previous games in detail.
4. I want to have stricter restrictions when attempting to sign up where it requires an actual email.
5. I was having difficulty with a footer throughout the development process. During deployment, buttons would not properly stay above the footer and be stuck underneath when playing the game.
6. Modal issues with mobile.
7. ]Having the capability to pkay against other players online.
